## Description

This is a simple Event Manager app done with UIKit.
App works with - CloudKit, MapKit, CoreLocation, UserNotifications

### Motivation 

This is my personal project I completed when attending DevMountain's iOS Bootcamp. This personal project was challenging as I had to work with sections and rows and with MapKit - a framework that was new to me. 

### Challenge 

The main challenge of this project was to learn how to use MapKit. In the iOS Bootcamp we did not learn how to use MapKit therefore I had to teach myself how to use it.
